          Dear Mom, <br />
          Your love has been my guiding light through every step of my journey.
          Your strength, your wisdom, and your endless patience have shaped me
          into who I am today. When I look at you, I see a woman of incredible
          resilience and grace. You've taught me how to face challenges with
          courage and how to celebrate life's joys with gratitude.
        </p>

      <div class="box3">
        <p>
          I remember all those late nights you stayed up helping with my
          homework, all the meals you prepared with love, all the times you put
          my needs before your own. Your selfless love has been the foundation
          on which I've built my life, and for that, I am eternally grateful. No
          words can truly express the depth of my love and appreciation for you,
          but I hope this small gesture brings a smile to your face. <br />
